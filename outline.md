Abstract

Introduction

- Motivation
- Summary of New Contributions

Literature Review (TODO: riley)

- Define caching
- Talking about prefetching
- Previous uses of entropy in caching
- Predictability vs cacheability
- Explanation of entropy
  - Conditional entropy
- Studies on stride prefetching

Methodology (TODO: ilana)

- Theoretical reasons to care about entropy
  - What we conditioned on and why
  - Strides (formal defn)
- Data (Trace Sources)
- Cache simulator (program details)

Results (TODO: bryant)

- Strides are predictable when conditioned on previous stride
- Quantification of preferability of stride prefetchers? (smth like that)
- Inconclusive results in terms of cachability

Conclusion & future work
